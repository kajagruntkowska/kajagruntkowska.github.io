I am a second-year PhD student at the KAUST Center of Excellence for Generative AI, supervised by Prof. [Peter Richt√°rik](https://richtarik.org/). My research focuses on developing the algorithmic and mathematical foundations of randomized optimization, with a particular emphasis on distributed computing. I work on designing practically motivated algorithms with provable convergence guarantees, bridging theory and real-world applications to advance scalable machine learning.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Statistics from the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/bsc-mathematics-statistics/) (2022) and a Master's in Statistical Science from the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-statistical-science) (2023).
